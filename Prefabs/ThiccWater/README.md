ThiccWater Using VRCFury
==

## How to install
* Import [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com) (that's the package you're looking at right now!)
* Import [Thicc Water by Pleasure Arcade](https://pleasurearcade.gumroad.com/l/thiccwater)
* Drag the `ThiccWater (VRCFury)` prefab from this folder onto wherever you'd like the fluids to emit from
* Rotate the prefab so the arrow points in the correct direction
* You're done!
* If fluid seems to be too large or too small in game, scale the prefab up or down
