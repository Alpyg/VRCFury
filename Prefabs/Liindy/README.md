Liindy Sniper Using VRCFury
==

> This prefab was contributed by `Morghus`, thank you!

## How to install
* Download and import [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/download)
* Import [Interactable Sniper Rifle (VRCHAT/SDK3)](https://liindy.gumroad.com/l/Tac300Sniper)
* Find the `Assets/VRCFury/Prefabs/Liindy` folder in the unity folder browser
* Drag the 'Sniper' prefab file from the folder onto the root of your avatar
* DO NOT UNPACK or follow the instructions that came with the original prefab
* Expand the 'Sniper' object that's now in your hierarchy and move all of the 'Target' objects
  to their correct positions. Do not move them in the hierarchy, just change the position and rotation
  in the scene.
   - 'Sniper Aim Constraint' - Move it to the palm of your left hand
   - 'Magazine Target' - Move it so the magazine fits nicely into your hand
   - 'Sniper_Hand_Target' - Move it to your right hand so it looks like you're holding it
   - 'Sniper_Chest_Target' - Move it to where your sniper should be attached on your back
   - 'Sniper_Chest_Sensor_Target' - Move it over your shoulder where you can grab it easily
* Done! VRCFury merges all the parameters, menus and animation controllers and re-parents the target
  objects automatically once you upload your avatar.
